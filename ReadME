This repository contains sample scripts concerning biologically-motivated neural network models from coursework and from literature. Examples include additive and shunting networks of various scales, networks incorporating recurrency and competitive networks. These networks can perform a variety of functions, such as input pattern preservation, short-term memory as described in electrophysiology studies, etc.
